  <h1>Important Concepts: Telling Computers What to Do</h1>
  <h1>Lesson 1</h1>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Introduction to "serious" programming</h2>
    </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Computer</div>
          <p>
            A computer is an universal machine that can be programmed to do essentially any computation.  
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Computer Program</div>
          <p>
            A computer program is a precise sequence of steps/links. Web browsers, games, mobile apps, and simple print statements are all examples of computer programs. 
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Programming Languages</div>
          <p>
            A programming language is what programmers use to tell a computer what to do. Python, Perl, Ruby are examples of programming languages.  
          </p>  
        <div class="concept-title">Python</div>
          <p>
            Python is a programming language. It is an interpreter, which means it runs programs, interprets them, and then executes them. Python runs the programs in a language the computer can understand directly.  
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Grammar</div>
          <p>
            Just like human languages have grammar, programming languages also do. A grammar is a specification of what is "correct" and what is "incorrect." In languages like English, people can often make sense of sentences that aren't technically "correct," due to experience and intuition. but computers do not have this capability. This means we have to write code that is exactly "correct" according to the Python interpreter, otherwise our code won't run.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Python Expressions</div>
          <p>
            A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. For example: <span class="code">print 1 + 1</span> is a valid expression, but <span class="code">print 1 +</span> (without a number at the end) is not. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud552-nd/l-3527838955/e-48704311/m-48736065" target="_blank">This video</a> does a good job of explaining the Python grammar for "expressions".
          </p>
    <h1>Lesson 2</h1>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Variables and Strings</h2>
    </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">What is a variable in Python?</div>
          <p>
            Is method of using names to refer to a value. For example if <span class="code">sample_variable</span> is a variable assigned with a value of "10", then the following command would display "10":
            <span class="code"> print sample_variable</span>.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">What does it meant to assign a value to a variable? How is it done?</div>
          <p>
            The code to assign a variable would look like the following:<br>
            <span class="code">sample_variable = 10</span>.<br>
            The value of variables can be re-assigned. 
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">What's the difference between what the equals sign = means in 2+3=5 and my_variable=5?</div>
          <p>
            In 2+3=5, it stands for equals or 'same as' as in the arithmetic definition.
            In my_variable=5, it means "my_variable" is assigned the value of 5. 
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">What are some ways that variables are useful?</div>
          <p>
          Variables can be useful to programmers in many ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>They improve code readability by using names that make sense to humans.</li>
            <li>They give us a way to store the value of important data.</li>
            <li>They give us a way to change the value of something (like in the line <span class="code">days = days-1</span></li>
          </ul>
        <div class="concept-title">What is the difference between 2 + 2 and "2" + "2"?</div>
          <p>
            In Python, <span class="code">2</span> is a number while <span class="code">"2"</span> is a string.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code <span class="code">2 + 2</span> would give <span class="code">4</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The code <span class="code">"2" + "2"</span> would give <span class="code">"22"</span>.
          </p>
    <h1>Lesson 3</h1>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Input -> Function -> Output</h2>
    </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">What is a function / procedure?</div>
          <p>
            A function is something that accepts input does an action on it and produces output. For example a function named add_together might take 2 number values as input and output the total value when added together.
          </p>
          <div class="concept-title">What is the difference between making and using a function?</div>
          <p>
            When making a function you are defining it. The line of code for a function begins with <b>def</b>, giving the function a name, then the function parameters in parentheses. The parameters will have values that are assigned when the function is used or called.
            <br>
            Below is an example of a function:
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="code">
                <span class="indent">def add_together(n):</span><br>
                <span class="indent">total = n + n</span><br>
                <span class="indent">return total</span><br>
            </span>
            <br>
            To use the function above, we can use the value of "2".
            <br>
            <span class="code">
                <span class="indent">print add_together(2)</span><br>
                <span class="indent">>>>4</span>
            </span>
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">How do functions help programmers avoid repetition?</div>
          <p>
            A function is a tool that developers can write once and reuse/reference in other parts of the code. This prevents the programmer from having to write the same logic again if it is needed.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">What happens if a function doesn't have a return statement?</div>
          <p>
            The <b>return</b> keyword tells Python what to output. If the <b>return</b> is not used, the output of your function cannot be printed.  Output will display as <b>None</b>
          </p>
    <h1>Lesson 4</h1>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Decision and Repetition: If and While</h2>
    </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Procedural Thinking</div>
          <p>
            Decision making and repetition. IF statements control which code gets executed when. WHILE loops make code that perfoms the same task many times.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Making Decisions</div>
          <p>
            Comparision operations &lt and &gt and == are some examples of making code behave differently based on decisions. The output of a comparision is a boolean value (true/false).
            <br><br>
            &lt  &gt &lt=
            <br>
            &ltnumber&gt&ltoperator&gt
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">If Statements</div>
          <p>
            If statements allow us to change the behavior of code depending on the outcome of a comparision.
            <br><br>
            if &ltTest Expressions&gt:
              &ltBlock&gt
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Or statements</div>
          <p>
            Example of use of OR below:
            <br><br>
            def is_friend(name):
              return name[0] == 'D' or name[0] == 'N'
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Break statements</div>
          <p>
            Break statements allow us to stop the loop even while the test condition is true. 
            <br><br>
            while &ltTest Expression&gt:
              &ltCode&gt
              if &ltBreak Text&gt:
                break
              &ltMore Code&gt
          </p>

    <h1>Lesson 5</h1>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>Structured Data: Lists and For Loops</h2>
    </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Lists</div>
          <p>
            Lists are another method to store data in a more structured object. Nested Lists are lists, contained inside another list separated by another set of [].
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">For Loops</div>
          <p>
            For Loops are a type of loop that iterates the same logic over on different parts of the structured data.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Mutation</div>
          <p>
            Mutation is changing the value of a string after we've have already created/defined it as a variable. Redefining the variable mutates it to refer to the new value, however there is no way to refer to the original value.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Aliasing</div>
          <p>
            Aliasing is two different ways to refer to the same object. For example two variables such as S and T could refer to the same object and if the value of S was changed, it would change the value of T also.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">List Operations</div>
          <p>
            The append operator is an example. It will add a new element to the end of a list, essentially mutating the list it is operating on.
            <br> <br>  
            &ltlist&gt.append(&ltelement&gt)
            <br><br>
            The plus operator is another one. It contatenates two lists together. It does not mutate the original list, it creates a new one.
            <br><br>
            &ltlist&gt + &ltlist&gt
            <br><br>
            The len operator len(&ltlist&gt) provides the length or number of elements of a list it is passed to. It can also calculate the number of characters in a string.
            <br><br>
            The Index operator &ltlist&gt.index(&ltvalue&gt) outputs the position of the value in the list.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">For Loops</div>
          <p>
            While loops are followed by a test expression. And if that test is true to execute the block. At the end of the block, go back to the while loop and repeat until test is False. <br>
            For loops like the one below mean that for each element in the list, we're going to assign that element to the name and evaluate the block.

            for &ltname&gt in &ltlist&gt:
                 &ltBlock&gt
          </p>
    <h1>Lesson 6 - Stage 3</h1>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h2>The Power of Abstraction</h2>
    </div>
      <div class="concept">
        <div class="concept-title">Module</div>
          <p>
            A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. This file can then be called inside your script mutliple times. This allows for flexiblity in your script and keeps it clean and orderly. This concept is similiar to how a CSS class can be used multiple times by an HTML script which would save some repeating lines of code.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Library</div>
          <p>
            Python has a standard library of "built in" modules that provides access to the system resources that would otherwise be unavailable to Python. An example would be urllib that allows python to open a link to an Internet web address.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Class</div>
          <p>
            A class is like a blueprint. A class can have both data and methods. It can be thought of as a basic receipe for a pie. Or in this case a receipe for code.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Instances</div>
          <p>
            An instance is a separate example of a class. For example, the class Turtle indicates the face that it has size and a color. Individual instances of the class Turtle will contain information about their size and their colors as well. Using the pie receipe example, an instance could be a blueberry pie, or a rasberry pie.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Constructor</div>
          <p>
            The constructor is the init method inside the class. It initializes all the data associated with the instance. It uses the keyword "Self"
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Instance variable</div>
          <p>
            Instance variables are all of the variables associated with a specific instance.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Instance methods</div>
          <p>
            Instance methods are all of the functions inside the class that are associated with an instance and have the first arguement as self.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Inheritance</div>
          <p>
            A subclass or Child that inherits attributes from the Parent class. This is another example of an advantage of Object Oriented Programming where it allows you to reuse code. Instead of copying the same piece of code many times over in a scipt, it can be referred to or inherited as a class.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Method overridding</div>
          <p>
            The ability of a subclass to override a method that it inherited from its parent class.
          </p>
        <div class="concept-title">Why OOP is a valuable tool for thinking about large projects.</div>
          <p>
            The main concept of OOP is the object which contains data and subroutines. It has a 'state' of data and responds to subroutines. These subroutines can manipulate the data as the programmer sees fit. You start by identifiying the objects within a problem and the messages that these objects shouold respond to. The solution or the final program would be a set of objects each with it's own data set and responsibilties. The objects interact with sending messages to each other.
            <br><br>
            As it helps reducing duplicate code, it also helps in updating code. You only need to update the function once, and it's updated everywhere it's called. Large projects can also have a large set of data. Classes allow as many "data types" as you need. The data can be grouped in some manner which makes it more manageable. 
            <br><br>
            Different from the standard top down approach of programming, OOP also includes a bottom up approach. There may be some parts of the project or issue to be solved that already have a known solution. These solutions are modules that can be reused and plugged into the code wherever they are needed. This allows programmers to reuse and share their work.
            <br><br>
            OOP provides flexibility and the ability to scale your code. It can be viewed as a collection of separate containers or objects that have actions between each other. The traditional top down methods are simply viewed as a group of functions and instructions.
          </p>
